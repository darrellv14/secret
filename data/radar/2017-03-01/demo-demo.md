This is a demo mantap entry. It is used to show how a radar item is written in Markdown format. The meta header is used to define the attributes of the item. The content of the file is used as the description of the item.

```tsx
// code higlighting works too
const var = 'Hello World! Aku Demo HAHA'
console.log(var)
```
